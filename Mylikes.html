        <h1>My Likes and Dislikes</h1>
        <p>I have never really thought of a list of likes and dislikes but for the purpose of this project. I will have to do that.
        </p>
        <p>Certain traits are considered as a 'No'. I will not even recommend a person with such traits. I'd like to consider them as 'dislikes'. Some other traits I admire in people, i will consider as 'likes'
